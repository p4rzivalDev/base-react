# Base - React

The intention with this project is to reduce the time it takes to create and configure a React project, just clone and install the dependencies with the following command:

```
  npm i
```

The base project was created with the ViteJs tool, a compiler that gives us a faster and more agile development experience indicated for modern web projects.
